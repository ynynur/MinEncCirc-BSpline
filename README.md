## MinEncCirc-BSpline


SUMMARY

An array containing N points in an integer coordinate plane is given [] []. The center and radius of the minimum circumscribing circle (MEC) were found. The minimum circumscribing circle is specified in the visual interface where all points are located inside or on the borders of the circle. The curve passing closest to the given N point was plotted.

In this project, C Programming Language was used and Graphics.h was preferred for interface design.

Requests given in the project were carried out functionally one by one. The coordinates of N points required for the 2 dimensional plane were read from a file (.txt). The X and Y coordinates of each point are available in the file and these points are shown on the screen in the coordinate plane.
The center point coordinates and radius of the smallest circle containing all points are calculated. And finally, the curve that passes the closest of the given points is drawn.
